# StopwatchBlues
Game Design Class 2015 Team 4 Project

Our game is a puzzle game where the player has a stopwatch that allows them to control time. They can either freeze global time or freeze one object. A frozen object will resume moving when global time is frozen. This mechanic will be used to solve various puzzles and make it to the goal (the top of a mysterious clocktower in the distance).
